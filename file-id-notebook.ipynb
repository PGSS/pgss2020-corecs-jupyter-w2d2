In this Notebook, first we will see first hand the ASCII encodings used in text files (and other textual data). After that we will apply what we've learned from our CSV lesson and use a very useful CSV file to identify files that are in a binary format.\n",

    "Many other files are not text at all and many file types have their own structure that has been perfected for a particular task. One common aspect between binary files is that they begin with a special byte signature that helps programs know whether this file is meant for them or not. Typically, this file signature is called the \"magic bytes\". Databases of these magic bytes are largely informal but on-the-whole pretty good. I have assembled our own CSV of magic bytes called `file-id-magic.csv`. Can you use this CSV in conjuction with Python to identify the unknown image files here called `blob1`, `blob2`, `blob3`?"
